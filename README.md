### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language used for analysis
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and clustering algorithms
- **Streamlit**: For deploying an interactive web application

### Project Structure
- `segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all analyses and clustering steps
- `app.py`: Streamlit application to deploy the clustering model

### Installation
To set up the environment and run this project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

### Usage
- **Run Notebook**: Open segmentation.ipynb to explore the code, analyses, and visualizations.
- **Run App**: Execute app.py to launch the Streamlit interface for customer segmentation.

### Results
- The clustering analysis provides insights into customer segments, such as high-spending, low-spending, and medium-spending groups, based on annual income and spending score.

### Contributing
- Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue to discuss what you would like to change.
